**Gender Analysis**

Of those that have left the Company 111 of them are female, whilst 123 are male employees. The attrition rate for women (34.2%) is significantly higher than that of men (27%), which may mean there is a gender issue as women are more likely to leave the company than men. Furthermore, men earn more pay than women which may the reason for women leaving the Company more than men.

**Pay Analysis across gender**

There are significantly more women that earn very low pay than men in the Company because of all the 24 employees that left Company earning very low pay, 20 of them are women. Thus, salary may be a very significant factor for women leaving the Company.

**Age Analysis**

The age range that has left the Company most is between 31 – 35 years, losing over 90 employees in that age range which is 38.9% of all the staff that left the Company. This is followed closely by the 26 – 30 years range, losing 65 employees. This shows the majority of the employees that left the Company are between the ages of 26-35years which accounts for over 66% of all the staff that have left the Company. This trend is quite alarming as it shows that the Company may be losing its young and vibrant minds. This may be due to the work culture or environment not matching the younger generations expectation and needs so they have decided to move on. The age range with the lowest attrition number is the 46-50years group with only one employee leaving.

**Job Role Analysis**

The majority of these specialists are also in the age range of 26-40 years. Their satisfaction rating of the Company is also mostly tilting towards dissatisfied and average, which shows there may not be happy with some of the culture within the Company. Considering the department and perform rating, which is mainly poor and below average, it can be assumed maybe most of the specialist that left the Company were unable to meet set target.

# Recommendation: 
1.	Male attrition is lower than female and, in the future, more female are likely to leave. There is a huge salary difference and imbalance between male and female employees even when you look at specialists’ employees’ salaries across gender.
	- Management should consider a salary review across board to ensure a commiserate salary amongst department, role and performance that does not leave suggestion of gender bias.
2.	The performance rate is highly poor, so maybe they are leaving because of poor performance and inability to meet set target.
	- Managements should consider whether the targets are unreasonably high and investing in further training so the employees are able to meet set target and not under perform. 
3.	Manage should also look into assessing its work culture and environment in order to determine why most of it its young age group are exiting the Company in comparison to the older age group. Thus, a team bonding retreat may be considered to gain this insight.
